## The paper is available at Environmental Research Letters: [Linking 'toxic outliers' to environmental justice communities](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/1/015004/meta).

You can find out more information about [SESYNC](www.sesync.org) and an additional press release produced by SESYNC is [available](http://www.sesync.org/news/toxic-outliers).

The map presented [here](http://ianamunoz.github.io/tri_map/) was generated from the 2009 EPA RSEI Microdata. The map was created in conjunction with SESYNC and Dr. Mary Collins. The grid layout was generated based on this techincal documentation. ([pdf](http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/rsei/pubs/rsei_users_manual_v2.3.2.pdf))

The map shows the aggregated toxic risk from fixed point facilities across the contiguous United States. 

The map data was originally generated with a PostGIS database. The vectortiles layer was built with Mapbox's [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/#win64).
