# EPA Risk Screening Environmental Indicators

The map presented [here](ianamunoz.github.io/tri_map/) was generated from the 2009 EPA RSEI Microdata. The map was created in conjunction with SESYNC and Dr. Mary Collins. The grid layout was generated based on the [techincal documentation](http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/rsei/pubs/rsei_users_manual_v2.3.2.pdf). 

The map shows the aggregated toxic risk from fixed point facilities across the contiguous United States. 

The map data was originally generated with a PostGIS database. The vectortiles layer was built with Mapbox's [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/#win64).
